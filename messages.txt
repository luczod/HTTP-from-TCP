Uh uh. I know what you're thinking.
"Did he fire six shots or only five?"
Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda: lost track myself.
But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off,
you've gotta ask yourself one question:
"Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?
